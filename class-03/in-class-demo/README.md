Here's a comparison and explanation of the different file I/O modes in Python:

Mode	File Exists	File Does Not Exist	Reading	Writing	Truncates File	Appends to File
r	Open	Error	Yes	No	No	No
r+	Open	Error	Yes	Yes	No	No
w	Truncate	Create	No	Yes	Yes	No
w+	Truncate	Create	Yes	Yes	Yes	No
a	Open	Create	No	Yes	No	Yes
a+	Open	Create	Yes	Yes	No	Yes
x	Error	Create	No	Yes	No	No
x+	Error	Create	Yes	Yes	No	No

r mode (read mode):
If the file exists, it opens the file for reading. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.
If the file does not exist, an error (FileNotFoundError) is raised.
This mode is not suitable for writing.
r+ mode (read and write mode):
(Explained in the previous answer)

w mode (write mode):
(Explained in the previous answer)

w+ mode (write and read mode):

If the file exists, it opens the file for both reading and writing, truncating (deleting) the existing content. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
The file can be both read and written, but the content is deleted when the file is opened.

a mode (append mode):
If the file exists, it opens the file for writing, and the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, so any new data will be appended.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
This mode is not suitable for reading.

a+ mode (append and read mode):
If the file exists, it opens the file for both reading and writing, and the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, so any new data will be appended.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
The file can be both read and written, and new data is always appended to the end.

x mode (exclusive creation mode):
If the file exists, an error (FileExistsError) is raised.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.
This mode is not suitable for reading.

x+ mode (exclusive creation and read mode):
If the file exists, an error (FileExistsError) is raised.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for both reading and writing.
The file can be both read and written, but it must not exist before opening.
Choose the appropriate mode for your use case to avoid data loss or errors.
