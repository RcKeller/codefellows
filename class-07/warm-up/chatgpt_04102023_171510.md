<strong>Warm-up Exercise: Finding the Middle Element of a Linked List</strong>

The goal of this exercise is to find the middle element of a singly linked list. We will use the multiple pointers technique to solve this problem efficiently. In this exercise, we'll have two pointers, a "slow" pointer, and a "fast" pointer.

The slow pointer will traverse the list one node at a time, while the fast pointer will traverse two nodes at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be pointing to the middle element of the list.

Here's a step-by-step guide to the tasks:

1. Create a simple Node class for the linked list. It should have a constructor that takes a value, and a "next" attribute initialized to None.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
```

2. Create a LinkedList class with a head attribute. Write a method to append new nodes to the end of the list.

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node
```

3. Now, implement the "find_middle" method using the multiple pointers technique. Follow the comments in the code to understand the process.

```python
class LinkedList(LinkedList):
    def find_middle(self):
        # Initialize slow and fast pointers to the head of the list
        slow = self.head
        fast = self.head

        # Traverse the list with the slow and fast pointers
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next          # Move the slow pointer one step
            fast = fast.next.next     # Move the fast pointer two steps

        # When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle
        return slow.value if slow else None
```

4. Finally, test your implementation with a few examples. The following test cases will help you verify the correctness of your code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test case 1: An empty linked list
    ll = LinkedList()
    assert ll.find_middle() == None

    # Test case 2: A linked list with a single element
    ll.append(1)
    assert ll.find_middle() == 1

    # Test case 3: A linked list with an odd number of elements
    ll.append(2)
    ll.append(3)
    assert ll.find_middle() == 2

    # Test case 4: A linked list with an even number of elements
    ll.append(4)
    assert ll.find_middle() == 2
```
