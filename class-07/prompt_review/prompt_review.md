## Prompt:
Can you help me design a simple CLI game written in Python?

## Response:

Sure, I can help you with that! What kind of game are you thinking of creating?

## Prompt:
Uno

## Response:

Great choice! Let's start by breaking down the game into its basic components and then we can build it up from there.

1. Deck of Cards

1. Hands

1. Discard Pile

1. Play Pile

1. Game Loop

Does this make sense so far?

## Prompt:
Sure! Thank you. But I have a different idea instead, let's design a game called Ten Thousand. It's a dice game that sometimes goes by the name of Farkle.

Here are the basic components:
1. There are 6 dice.
2. Users can bank dice.
3. Choose which dice to keep.
4. Scoring is like Farkle (based on three of a kind or more, straight, or three doubles, 1s, 5s).
5. A game is broken into rounds. 20 rounds total

Here are some example inputs and prints that show how the game works:

```
Welcome to Ten Thousand
(y)es to play or (n)o to decline
> y
Starting round 1
Rolling 6 dice...
*** 3 2 5 4 3 3 ***
Enter dice to keep, or (q)uit:
> 3335
You have 350 unbanked points and 2 dice remaining
(r)oll again, (b)ank your points or (q)uit:
> b
You banked 350 points in round 1
Total score is 350 points
Starting round 2
Rolling 6 dice...
*** 5 2 3 2 1 4 ***
Enter dice to keep, or (q)uit:
> 15
You have 150 unbanked points and 4 dice remaining
(r)oll again, (b)ank your points or (q)uit:
> b
You banked 150 points in round 2
Total score is 500 points
Starting round 3
Rolling 6 dice...
*** 6 6 5 4 2 1 ***
Enter dice to keep, or (q)uit:
> q
Thanks for playing. You earned 500 points
```

```
Welcome to Ten Thousand

Enter dice to keep, or (q)uit:
> 5
You have 50 unbanked points and 5 dice remaining
(r)oll again, (b)ank your points or (q)uit:
> b
You banked 50 points in round 1
Total score is 50 points
Starting round 2
Rolling 6 dice...

```

```
Welcome to Ten Thousand
(y)es to play or (n)o to decline
> n
OK. Maybe another time
```

```

## Response:

Great, let's get started! Here is a Python implementation of the game that you described:

```python
import random

def roll_dice(num_dice):
    """Rolls a given number of dice and returns the result."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)]

def print_dice(dice):
    """Prints the dice in a pretty format."""
    print('***', ' '.join(map(str, dice)), '***')

def get_score(dice):
    """Calculates the score for a given set of dice."""
    score = 0
    dice_counts = [dice.count(i) for i in range(1, 7)]
    if 3 in dice_counts:
        # Three of a kind
        score += 1000 + (dice_counts.index(3) + 1 - 1) * 100
        for i in range(3):
            dice.remove(dice_counts.index(3) + 1)
    if 4 in dice_counts:
        # Four of a kind
        score += 1000 + (dice_counts.index(4) + 1 - 1) * 100
        for i in range(4):
            dice.remove(dice_counts.index(4) + 1)
    if 5 in dice_counts:
        # Five of a kind
        score += 2000 + (dice_counts.index(5) + 1 - 1) * 200
        for i in range(5):
            dice.remove(dice_counts.index(5) + 1)
    if 6 in dice_counts:
        # Six of a kind
        score += 3000 + (dice_counts.index(6) + 1 - 1) * 300
        for i in range(6):
            dice.remove(dice_counts.index(6) + 1)
    if sorted(dice) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
        # Straight
        score += 1500
        dice.clear()
    if dice_counts[0] >= 3:
        # Three ones
        score += 1000
        for i in range(3):
            dice.remove(1)
    if dice_counts[4] >= 3:
        # Three fives
        score += 500
        for i in range(3):
            dice.remove(5)
    return score

def play_round(round_num, total_score):
    """Plays a single round of the game and returns the score."""
    print(f'Starting round {round_num}')
    dice = roll_dice(6)
    print_dice(dice)
    banked_score = 0
    num_dice = 6
    while True:
        response = input('Enter dice to keep, or (q)uit: ')
        if response == 'q':
            break
        keep_dice = [int(d) for d in response if d in '123456']
        if not keep_dice:
            continue
        num_keep = len(keep_dice)
        num_dice -= num_keep
        banked_score += get_score(keep_dice)
        if num_dice == 0:
            num_dice = 6
            if banked_score == 0:
                print('Farkle!')
                banked_score = 0
                break
            else:
                print(f'You have {banked_score} unbanked points and {num_dice} dice remaining')
                response = input('(r)oll again, (b)ank your points or (q)uit: ')
                if response == 'b':
                    total_score += banked_score
                    print(f'
```

## Prompt:
Please continue the code block. Start with ```

## Response:

Sure thing! Here's the rest of the code block:

```python
                    You banked {banked_score} points in round {round_num}')
                    break
        else:
            print(f'You have {banked_score} unbanked points and {num_dice} dice remaining')
    return total_score

def play_game():
    """Plays a full game of Ten Thousand."""
    print('Welcome to Ten Thousand')
    while True:
        response = input('(y)es to play or (n)o to decline: ')
        if response == 'n':
            print('OK. Maybe another time')
            return
        if response == 'y':
            total_score = 0
            for round_num in range(1, 21):
                total_score = play_round(round_num, total_score)
                print(f'Total score is {total_score} points')
            print(f'Thanks for playing. You earned {total_score} points')
            return
```

To play the game, you can simply call the <code>play_game()</code> function. It will prompt you to enter <code>(y)es</code> to play or <code>(n)o</code> to decline. If you choose to play, it will run through 20 rounds of the game and then display your total score at the end.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do for you.
