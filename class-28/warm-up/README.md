# Django Warm Up

Today we'll be answering the question, "**How** does Django work?".

> Please reference the `in-class-demo` and the corresponding `django_things_crud` project for this warm up. Imagine that the development server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Problem Domain

- What happens when you visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` ?
    - Answer this by tracing the code through `VUT`; the views urls and templates
    - For example:
        1. Django searches for the matching url pattern in the project's urls.py. Specifically in `urlpatterns`.
        1. ? (steps in between)
        1. The html in `base.html`
