# Class 09 Warm Up

Let's get more reps in! Since we're about to finish up with Linked Lists let's build some muscle memory.

- Create a Node class
- Create a LinkedList class
- Create a method to append to a LinkedList
- Create a method to traverse a LinkedList and print the values of each node

Then create a new LinkedList, add some nodes, and then invoke your method to print each value.

Try to go from memory if you can. Everyone should do work in their own repl.it for the practice.
