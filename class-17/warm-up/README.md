**Problem 1: Calculate the sum of all elements in a list**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- **A1:** We can iterate over the list
- **A2:** For each number in the list, we can add it to a running total
- **B2:** The sum is obtained by adding each number one by one
- **B1:** The sum is the result of this addition
- **B:** The sum of all numbers in the list is 15


**Problem 2: Determine if a word is a palindrome**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A string "radar"
- **A1:** We can reverse the string
- **A2:** We can compare the reversed string with the original string
- **B2:** A string is a palindrome if the reversed string is the same as the original string
- **B1:** The result of the comparison is the answer
- **B:** The string "radar" is a palindrome (True)


**Problem 3: Find the maximum number in a list**

**Forward/Backward Process:**
- **A:** A list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- **A1:** We can iterate over the list
- **A2:** For each number in the list, we can compare it with a running maximum and update the maximum if the current number is larger
- **B2:** The maximum number is found by comparing each number with a running maximum
- **B1:** The maximum number is the result of these comparisons
- **B:** The maximum number in the list is 5
