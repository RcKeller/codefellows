# Intro to Python

Introduction to Python Language

## Class Outline

<!-- To Be Completed By Instructor -->
- Kick-off and Introductions
- Course Overview
- Setting up Python
- Basic Python Review
- Virtual Environments
- Command-line scripts and user input

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Python scripts & modules
- Virtual Environments
- Daily whiteboarding practice
- Big-O notation for describing the complexity of an algorithm

#### Execute

- Install Python 3 on their systems
- Python scripts from command line
- Import packages of external code
- Organize code into modules
- Create virtual environments for isolating their packages from their system Python
- Receive input from user via command line
- Set up a professional development environment

## Notes

Ensure that you've completed the [401 Python Prework](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/prework/){:target="_blank"}.

It's extremely critical that you're set up and ready to go on day 1, and if not you need to **notify your instructor** as soon as possible regarding any of the prework that you were unable to complete.

## Code Challenge 01 Notes:

1. [Create your DSA repository](https://github.com/codefellows/data-structures-and-algorithms/generate) if you haven't already
1. Example [DSA repository](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/)
1. Create a new branch named after the code challenge, in this case Code Challenge 01 is called `array-reverse`, but since this is python we're going to call it `list-reverse`. [Example](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/list-reverse)
1. Create a new folder called `list_reverse` inside `/python/docs/`. [Example](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/python/docs/list_reverse)
1. Create a `README.md` file and whiteboard screenshot inside of `list_reverse`. [Example](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/python/docs/list_reverse)

    - Use this README.md template:

    ```markdown
    # Challenge Title
    <!-- Description of the challenge -->

    ## Whiteboard Process
    <!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

    ## Approach & Efficiency
    <!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

    ## Solution
    <!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
    ```

    - [Example](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/docs/list_reverse/README.md)

- Create a pull request from your feature branch into main. [Example](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/1)

    - Use this checklist for the PR comment:

    ```markdown
    - [ ] Top-level README “Table of Contents” is updated
    - [ ] README for this challenge is complete
        - [ ] Summary, Description, Approach & Efficiency, Solution
        - [ ] Picture of whiteboard
        - [ ] Link to code
    - [ ] Feature tasks for this challenge are completed
    - [ ] Unit tests written and passing
        - [ ] “Happy Path” - Expected outcome
        - [ ] Expected failure
        - [ ] Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
    ```

- Add a section to the /python/README.md for a Table of Contents entry. Bottom of [here](https://github.com/adamowada/python-401n7-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/python) for example.
